# Usage: ./order.pl
#
# This program illustrates the way pack_start and pack_end interoperate.
# Packing like this is a standard thing for any widget implementing
# GtkCellLayout, and it's the same as pack_start/pack_end in a GtkBox.
#
# Basically within each model item the pack_start renderers are drawn from
# the left and then the pack_end renderers from the right.  TickerView
# doesn't leave any space in the middle, so it ends up being the starts
# drawn in order then the ends drawn in reverse order (ie. going from the
# right).  Thus the renderers below (which ignore the data in the model),
# get added as "starts" 1, 2, 3 then "ends" 4, 5, 6, and give "1 2 3 6 5 4".
