# The private per-object fields are:
#
# vertical  0 or 1
#     0 when horizontal, 1 when vertical.  Presented through GET_PROPERTY
#     and SET_PROPERTY as Gtk2::Orientation 'horizontal' and 'vertical', but
#     internally the number allows computed indexes instead of conditionals.
#
# pixmap  Gtk2::Gdk::Pixmap or undef
#     Established in _pixmap(), undef until then.
#
# pixmap_size
#     The width of pixmap when horizontal, or height when vertical.  This is
#     established by _pixmap_desired_size() and thus may be set before
#     pixmap is actually created.
#
# row_widths   hashref { $index => $width }
#     $index is an integer row number.  $width is the total width of all the
#     renderers' drawing of that row.
#
#     This is a hash instead of an array so as to keep widths for roughly
#     just the rows displayed, which may be a good thing on a big model.
#     Widths are discarded when _pixmap_shift drops rows off the left edge,
#     and when _pixmap_empty purges the whole pixmap.  Widths are stored by
#     _pixmap_extend, so the displayed rows are present, ready for
#     _normalize() to use contemplating an increment of want_index.
#
#     Widths are also saved by normalize actions like a big scroll_pixels()
#     or a get_path_at_pos() of an off-screen position.  Those widths end up
#     remaining until a full redraw or until shifting passes them by.  Which
#     is probably no bad thing if one off-screen position calculation is
#     reasonably likely to be followed by another.  Might be worth thinking
#     more about that though.
#
#     The widths of drawn rows are implicitly in drawn_array as the
#     difference between successive $x values, so having them in
#     'row_widths' is a bit of duplication.  If _normalize() looked at
#     drawn_array the drawn rows could be omitted, but almost certainly the
#     code size would outweigh the data space.
#
# drawn_array   arrayref [ $index, $x, $index, $x, ... ]
#     Each $index is an integer row number.  Each $x is the position in
#     'pixmap' where row $index has been drawn.  There's two things helped
#     by saveing all drawn positions,
#
#     1. _pixmap_shift() is easier.  It can decrement each $x by the shift
#        amount and look for the last $x <= 0 as the drawn rows retained.
#        When the last row has been chopped off at the right edge (which is
#        almost always) the second last position is immediately available to
#        become pixmap_end_x, and the last index is pixmap_end_index to
#        extend from.
#
#        If all positions weren't recorded then _pixmap_shift() would have
#        to reconstruct them to find that $x <= 0 point and the second last
#        row pos, by adding up row widths.
#
#     2. _pixmap_find_want() can contemplate two drawn copies of a given
#        row.  There might be one at the start which starts a bit off screen
#        at the left, and another later in the pixmap.  When want_x allows
#        the first to be used it makes best use of the current pixmap
#        contents.  If not then the second is a fallback and if it's too far
#        to the right then might still be usable if _pixmap_shift() moves it
#        down.
#
#     Point 2 might be covered by retaining two positions for each row: its
#     leftmost and then second leftmost (if any).  _pixmap_shift() would
#     still be tricky though, if it tried to find a new second leftmost for
#     those rows whose leftmost had gone off-screen.
#
#     Rows of zero width are still entered in drawn_array.  This ensures
#     _do_row_changed, _do_row_deleted, etc, notice that those rows are
#     on-screen.  It's possible want_index is a zero width row if an
#     explicit scroll_to_start has gone there (or a hypothetical
#     scroll_to_iter or something like that).  _normalize() normally doesn't
#     leave want_index on a zero width when moving though.
#
# want_x, want_index  integers
#     want_index is the desired row number (counting from 0) to be shown at
#     the start of the ticker window.  want_x is an x position where the
#     left edge of the want_index row should start.  want_x is zero or
#     negative.  Negative means the want_index item is partly off the left
#     edge.
#
#     Scrolling will soon make want_x a larger negative than the width of
#     the want_index row.  Expose (using _normalize()) looks for that and
#     moves up by incrementing want_index and adding the skipped row width
#     to want_x.  It can go across multiple rows that way if necessary.
#
#     Scrolling backwards can make want_x go positive.  _normalize_want()
#     and _normalize() again adjust, this time by decrementing want_index to
#     a preceding row and subtracting that width from want_x, working back
#     to find what row should be at or just before the left edge.
#
# pixmap_end_x
#     The x just after the endmost drawn part of the pixmap.  pixmap_end_x
#     is truncated to pixmap_size when full or when the model is empty or
#     all zero width rows.
#
#     Until pixmap_end_x is faked to pixmap_size it's equal to the last
#     drawn_array entry plus that entry's row_width.  But the fakery to
#     pixmap_size means it's easier to maintain pixmap_end_x separately than
#     to build from drawn_array each time.
#
#     The pixmap starts with only as much content as needed for expose to
#     show the expose region the want_index/want_x position.  As
#     want_x,want_index advance _pixmap_extend() draws more content at
#     pixmap_end_x.
#
#     The "undrawn" area from pixmap_end_x onwards is always cleared to the
#     background colour (in _pixmap_redraw() and _pixmap_shift()), so
#     _pixmap_extend() can just draw.  Some of that area might never be used
#     but the idea is to do a single big XDrawRectangle instead of several
#     small ones.
#
# visibility_state  Gtk2::Gdk::VisibilityState enum string or 'initial'
#     This is maintained from the 'visiblity-notify-event' handler.  If
#     'fully-obscured' then the scroll timer is stopped, to save a bit of
#     work when nothing can be seen.
#
# drag_xy   arrayref [ $root_x, $root_y ]
#     During a drag this is the last position of the mouse, in root window
#     coordinates.  When not in drag 'drag_xy' is not in $self at all.  The
#     timer is stopped while drag_xy is set.  Only one of the two x or y are
#     used, according to 'vertical', but storing not much extra and it
#     smoothly handles the slightly freaky case of a change of orientation
#     in the middle of a drag.
#
# model_empty  boolean
#     True when we believe $self->{'model'} is empty.  Initialized in
#     SET_PROPERTY when the model is first set, then kept up to date in
#     _do_row_inserted() and _do_row_deleted().
#
#     The aim of this is to give _do_row_inserted() a way to be sure when
#     the model transitions from empty to non-empty, which provokes a resize
#     and a possible timer restart.
#
#     Testing for model length == 1 in _do_row_inserted() would be very
#     nearly enough, but not perfect.  If an earlier connected row-inserted
#     handler inserts yet another row in response to the first insertion
#     then by the time _do_row_inserted() runs it sees length==2.  This
#     would be pretty unusual, and probably needs 'iters-persist' on the
#     model for the first iter to remain valid past the extra model change,
#     but it's not completely outrageous.
#
# In RtoL mode all the x positions are measured from the right edge of the
# window or pixmap instead.  Only the expose and the cell renderer drawing
# must mirror those RtoL logical positions into LtoR screen coordinates.
#
# In vertical orientation the "x" values are in fact y positions and the
# "width"s are in fact heights.  Stand by for a search and replace to
# something neutral like "p" and "size" or whatever :-).

#
# Twice the window width gives a reasonable amount of hidden pixmap
# buffering off the window ends.  However if the window is unusually narrow
# it could be much less than a typical row, so impose a minimum of half the
# screen width.

# (Maybe a maximum of say twice the screen width could be imposed too, so
# that a hugely wide window doesn't result in a massive pixmap.  But for a
# pixmap smaller than the window we'd have to notice what portion of the
# window is on-screen.  Probably that's much more trouble than it's worth.
# If you ask for a stupidly wide window then expect to have your pixmap

# scroll timer
#
# _update_timer() starts or stops the timer according to the numerous
# conditions set out in that func.  In general the idea is not to run the
# timer when there's nothing to see and/or move: eg. the window is not
# visible, or there's nothing in the model+renderers.  Care must be taken to
# call _update_timer() when any of the conditions may have changed.
#
# The timer action itself is pretty simple, it just calls the public
# $self->scroll_pixels() to make the move, by an amount based on elapsed
# real time, per "OTHER NOTES" in the pod below.  The hairy stuff in
# scroll_pixels() collapsing multiple motions and drawing works just as well
# from the timer as it does from application uses of that func.  In fact the
# collapsing exists mainly to help if the timer runs a touch too fast for
# the server's drawing.
#

# _TIMER_PRIORITY is below the drawing priority GDK_PRIORITY_EVENTS in
# _sync_call_handler(), so drawing of the current position goes out before
# making a scroll to a new position.
#
# Try _TIMER_PRIORITY below GDK_PRIORITY_REDRAW too, to hopefully cooperate
# with redrawing of other widgets, letting their drawing go out before
# scrolling the ticker.
#
use constant _TIMER_PRIORITY => (GDK_PRIORITY_REDRAW + 10);

# _gettime() returns a floating point count of seconds since some fixed but
# unspecified origin time.
#
# clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME) is preferred.  clock_gettime() always
# exists, but it croaks if there's no such C library func.  In that case
# fall back on the hires time(), which is whatever best thing Time::HiRes
# can do, probably gettimeofday() normally.
#
# Maybe it'd be worth checking clock_getres() to see it's a decent
# resolution.  It's conceivable some old implementations might do
# CLOCK_REALTIME just from the CLK_TCK times() counter, giving only 10
# millisecond resolution.  That's enough for a modest 10 or 20 frames/sec,
# but if attempting say 100 frames on a fast computer for ultra smoothness
# then higher resolution would be needed.

# dragging
#
# The basic operation here is pretty simple, it's just a matter of calling
# the public $self->scroll_pixels() with each mouse move amount as reported
# by motion-notify.  The hairy stuff in scroll_pixels() to collapse moving
# and drawing works just as well for moves here as for application calls.
#
# If someone does a grab_pointer, either within the program or another
# client, then we'll no longer get motion notifies.  Should timer based
# scrolling resume immediately, or only on button release?  If the new grab
# is some unrelated action taking over then immediately might be best.  But
# only on button release may be more consistent, in having the timer
# scrolling resume only on button release.  The latter is done for now.
#
# If the window is moved during the drag, either repositioned by application
# code, or repositioned by the window manager etc, then it's possible to
# either
#
# 1. Let the displayed contents stay with the left edge of the window.
# 2. Let the displayed contents stay with the mouse, so it's like the
#    window move reveals a different portion.
#
# Neither is too difficult, but 1 is adopted since in 2 there's a bit of
# flashing when the server copies the contents with the move and they then
# have to be redrawn.  (Redrawn under size-allocate, since there's only
# configure-notify for a window move, no mouse motion-notify event.)
#
# Perhaps the double-buffering extension could help with the flashing, but
# it'd have to be applied to the parent window, and could only work when the
# move originates client-side, not say from the window manager.  For now 1
# is easier, and window moves during a drag should be fairly unusual anyway.
#
# To implement 1 the mouse position for dragging is maintained in root
# window coordinates.  This means it's independent of the ticker window
# position.  On that basis don't need to pay any attention to the window
# position, simply apply root window based mouse motion to scroll_pixels().
# Both x and y are maintained so that you can actually change the
# "orientation" property in the middle of a drag and still get the right
# result!

=head1 WIDGET HIERARCHY

C<Gtk2::Ex::TickerView> is a subclass of C<Gtk2::DrawingArea>, but that
might change so it's recommended you only rely on C<Gtk2::Widget>.

    Gtk2::Widget
      Gtk2::DrawingArea
        Gtk2::Ex::TickerView

The interfaces implemented are:

    Gtk2::Buildable (Gtk 2.12 and up)
    Gtk2::CellLayout

The C<orientation> property is compatible with the Gtk2::Orientable
interface, but that interface can't be added as of Perl-Gtk 1.221.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A C<Gtk2::Ex::TickerView> widget displays items from a C<Gtk2::TreeModel>
scrolling across the window, like a news bar or stock ticker.

    +----------------------------------------------------------+
    | st item  * The second item  * The third item   * The fou |
    +----------------------------------------------------------+
        <---- scrolling

Or in C<vertical> orientation it scrolls upwards.

    +-------+
    | Two   |  ^
    | Three |  |
    | Four  |  | scrolling
    | Five  |  |
    | Six   |  |
    | ...   |
    +-------+

Items are drawn with one or more C<Gtk2::CellRenderer> objects set into the
TickerView as per the CellLayout interface (see L<Gtk2::CellLayout>).  For
example to scroll text you can use C<Gtk2::CellRendererText> as a renderer.

If two or more renderers are set then they're drawn one after the other for
each item, ie. row of the model.  For example you could have a
C<Gtk2::CellRendererPixbuf> to draw an icon then a C<Gtk2::CellRendererText>
to draw some text and they scroll across together (or upwards on top of each
other when vertical).  The icon could use the row data, or just be a fixed
image to go before every item.

     +-----------------------------------------------+
     |    +--------++--------++--------++--------+   |
     | ...| Pixbuf || Text   || Pixbuf || Text   |...|
     |    | row 35 || row 35 || row 36 || row 36 |   |
     |    +--------++--------++--------++--------+   |
     +-----------------------------------------------+

The display and scrolling direction follow the left-to-right or
right-to-left of C<set_direction> (see L<Gtk2::Widget>).  For C<ltr> mode
item 0 starts at the left of the window and items scroll to the left.  For
C<rtl> item 0 starts at the right of the window and items scroll to the
right.

    +----------------------------------------------------------+
    | m five  * item four  * item three  * item two  * item on |
    +----------------------------------------------------------+
                        rtl mode, scrolling ----->

In vertical mode C<ltr> scrolls upwards and C<rtl> scrolls downwards.  This
doesn't make as much sense as it does horizontally.  (Perhaps it should
change, though if you have to set vertical orientation it's not too terrible
that C<set_direction> is the slightly unusual case of a downwards scroll.)

Within each renderer cell any text or drawing direction is a matter for that
renderer.  For example in C<Gtk2::CellRendererText> Pango recognises
right-to-left scripts such as Arabic based on the characters and shouldn't
need any special setups.  (But if you want to rotate 90 degrees for
something vertical it might be much trickier -- just setting text "gravity"
doesn't work.)

Currently only a list style model is expected, meaning only a single level,
and only that topmost level of the model is drawn.  For example a
C<Gtk2::ListStore> suits.  Perhaps in the future something will be done to
descend into and draw subrows too.

The whole Gtk model/view/layout/renderer/attributes as used here is
ridiculously complicated.  Its power comes when showing a big updating list
or wanting customized drawing, but the amount of code to get something on
the screen is not nice.  Have a look at "Tree and List Widget Overview" in
the Gtk reference manual if you haven't already.  Then F<examples/simple.pl>
in the TickerView sources is more or less the minimum to actually display
something.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=over 4

=item C<< $ticker = Gtk2::Ex::TickerView->new (key => value, ...) >>

Create and return a new C<Gtk2::Ex::TickerView> widget.  Optional key/value
pairs set initial properties as per C<< Glib::Object->new >> (see
L<Glib::Object>).

=item C<< $ticker->scroll_pixels ($n) >>

Scroll the ticker contents across by C<$n> pixels.  Postive C<$n> moves in
the normal scrolled direction or negative goes backwards.

The display position is maintained as a floating point value so fractional
C<$n> amounts accumulate until a whole pixel step is reached.

=item C<< $ticker->scroll_to_start () >>

Scroll the ticker contents back to the start, ie. to show the first row of
the model at the left end of the window (or upper end for vertical, or right
end for C<rtl>, or bottom end for vertical plus C<rtl>!).

=item C<< $path = $ticker->get_path_at_pos ($x, $y) >>

Return a C<Gtk2::TreePath> which is the model row displayed at C<$x>,C<$y>,
or return C<undef> if there's nothing displayed there.  There can be nothing
if no C<model> is set, or it has no rows, or all rows are zero width or not
visible (the renderer C<visible> property).

C<$x> can be outside the window, in which case the item which would be shown
at that point is still returned.  C<$y> is currently ignored, since all
items simply use the full window height.  Perhaps in the future a C<$y>
outside the window height will cause an C<undef> return.

=back

=head1 OBJECT PROPERTIES

=over 4

=item C<model> (object implementing C<Gtk2::TreeModel>, default undef)

This is any C<Glib::Object> implementing the C<Gtk2::TreeModel> interface,
for example a C<Gtk2::ListStore>.  It supplies the data to be displayed.
Until this is set the ticker is blank.

=item C<run> (boolean, default true)

Whether to run the ticker, ie. to scroll it across under a timer.  If false
then the ticker just draws the items at its current position without moving
(except by the programatic scroll functions above, or user dragging with
mouse button 1).

=item C<speed> (floating point pixels per second, default 25)

The speed the items scroll across, in pixels per second.

=item C<frame-rate> (floating point frames per second, default 4)

The number of times each second the ticker moves and redraws.  Each move
will be C<speed> divided by C<frame-rate> many pixels.

The current current code uses the Glib main loop timer so the frame rate
becomes integer milliseconds for actual use.  A minimum 1 millisecond is
imposed, meaning frame rates more than 1000 are treated as 1000.  Of course
1000 frames a second is pointlessly high.

=item C<orientation> (C<Gtk2::Orientation> enum, default C<"horizontal">)

If set to C<"vertical"> the ticker items are drawn vertically from the top
of the window downwards, and scroll up the screen.  Or with C<set_direction>
of C<rtl> mode the direction reverses so they're drawn from the bottom of
the window upwards, and scroll down the screen.

(The name C<rtl> doesn't make a great deal of sense in vertical mode.
Something to reverse the direction is certainly desired, but perhaps it
shouldn't be the LtoR/RtoL setting ...)

=item C<fixed-height-mode> (boolean, default false)

If true then assume all rows in the model have the same height and that it
doesn't change.  This allows the ticker to get its desired height by asking
the renderers about just one row of the model, instead of going through them
all and resizing on every insert, delete or change.  If the model is big
this is a significant speedup.

If you force a height with C<set_size_request> in the usual widget fashion
then you should turn on C<fixed-height-mode> too because under
C<set_size_request> the sizing mechanism ends up running the widget size
code even though it then overrides the result.

=back

The C<visible> property in each cell renderer is recognised and a renderer
that's not visible is skipped and takes no space.  C<visible> can be set
globally in the renderer to suppress it entirely, or controlled with the
attributes mechanism or data setup function to suppress it just for selected
rows from the model.

(Suppressing lots of rows using C<visible> might be a bit slow since
TickerView basically must setup the renderers for each row to see the state.
A C<Gtk2::TreeModelFilter> may be a better way to pick out a small number of
desired rows from a very big model.)

=head1 BUILDABLE

C<Gtk2::Ex::TickerView> implements the C<Gtk2::Buildable> interface of Gtk
2.12 and up, allowing C<Gtk2::Builder> to construct a TickerView.  The class
name is C<Gtk2__Ex__TickerView> and renderers and attributes are added as
children per C<Gtk2::CellLayout>.  Here's a sample, or see
F<examples/builder.pl> in the TickerView sources for a complete program,

    <object class="Gtk2__Ex__TickerView" id="myticker">
      <property name="model">myliststore</property>
      <child>
        <object class="GtkCellRendererText" id="myrenderer">
          <property name="xpad">10</property>
        </object>
        <attributes>
          <attribute name="text">0</attribute>
        </attributes>
      </child>
    </object>

But see L<Gtk2::Ex::CellLayout::Base/BUILDABLE INTERFACE> for caveats about
widget superclass tags (like the "accessibility" settings) which end up
unavailable (as of Gtk2-Perl 1.221 at least).

=head1 OTHER NOTES

Mouse button 1 is setup for the user to drag the display back and forwards.
This is good to go back and see something that's just moved off the edge, or
to skip past boring bits.  Perhaps in the future the button used will be
customizable.

The Gtk reference documentation for C<GtkCellLayout> doesn't really describe
how C<pack_start> and C<pack_end> order the cells, but it's the same as
C<GtkBox> and a description can be found there.  Basically each cell is
noted as "start" or "end", with "starts" drawn from the left and "ends" from
the right (vice versa in RtoL mode).  In a TickerView the ends immediately
follow the starts, there's no gap in between, unlike say in a C<Gtk2::HBox>.
(Which means the "expand" parameter is ignored currently.)  See
F<examples/order.pl> in the sources for a demonstration.

When the model has no rows the TickerView's desired height from
C<size_request> is zero.  This is bad if you want a visible but blank area
when there's nothing to display.  However there's no way TickerView can work
out a height when it's got no data at all to set into the renderers.  You
can try calculating a fixed height from a sample model and
C<set_size_request> to force that, or alternately have a "no data" row
displaying in the model instead of letting it go empty, or even switch to a
dummy model with a "no data" row when the real one is empty.

=head2 Drawing

Cells are drawn into an off-screen pixmap which is copied to the window at
successively advancing X positions as the ticker scrolls across.  The aim is
to run the model fetching and cell rendering just once for each row as it
appears on screen.  This is important because the model+renderer mechanism
is generally much too slow to call frame-rate times per second.

The drawing for scroll movement goes through a SyncCall (see
L<Gtk2::Ex::SyncCall>) so that after drawing one frame the next doesn't go
out until hearing back from the server that it finished the previous.  This
ensures a high frame rate doesn't flood the server with more drawing than it
can keep up with, but instead dynamically caps at client+server capability.

Scroll movements are calculated from elapsed time using
C<clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME)> when available or high-res system time
otherwise (see C<Time::HiRes>).  This means the C<speed> setting is followed
even if drawing doesn't keep up with the requested C<frame-rate>.  Slow
frame rates can occur on the client side if the main loop is busy doing
other things (including temporarily blocked completely), or can be on the X
server side if it's busy with other drawing etc.
