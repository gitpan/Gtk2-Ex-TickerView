Gtk2::Ex::TickerView is a horizontal scrolling stock ticker or newsbar
using the Gtk model/view style of Gtk2::TreeView.  You supply data in
a model (such as Gtk2::ListStore, or your own custom model) and
TickerView displays the items scrolling across the screen.

CellRenderers are used to draw allowing lots of styles or custom
drawing.  Left-to-right and right-to-left display and scrolling are
both supported.

The only prerequisite is Gtk2-Perl.  The TickerView home page is
